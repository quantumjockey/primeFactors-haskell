primeFactors-haskell
====================

An attempt at the "Prime Factors" code kata in Haskell (tested with Hspec).

This is a replica of the Haskell Code Kata I performed for the [Las Vegas Functional Programming User Group](http://www.meetup.com/las-vegas-functional-programming/) as part of the July 31st, 2014 meeting. Each commit represents a step taken to obtain the solution in the original Kata, including exposure and execution of unit tests for pass/fail.

This repository isn't necessarily meant for development, but feel free to clone and play with it.

Additional katas, software, and fun functional programming magic by the organizers, other members, and myself can be found on the group's [Github Profile](https://github.com/LasVegasFunctionalProgrammingGroup). We welcome everyone and anyone with an interest in the functional programming paradigm, its languages, and its practices - as well as anyone who enjoys problem solving. Find us on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/las-vegas-functional-programming/) and come on down!
